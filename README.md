WARNING: I am switching from GitHub to my own git hosting. This means that I will NOT provide new code to GitHub and instead push it to my own git repository. If you plan on using these scripts I recommend to go to https://gitlab.danielhosting.nl/Daniel-Doggy/php-tooling and get the latest changes from there.
